Description : Can you find them all?

**Solution** : 

This challenge was very interesting because it requires to use more your brain than online tool. So let's focus on the first picture. 

![Picture 1](https://i.ibb.co/HKyVwt1/1.png)

We can see a doll, a lamp and finally a house in the background. You can try all the reverse image tools that exists, they won't give any results. 
The big hint here is the doll. At first, I thought it was a scarescrow but it didn't give any results. So after a while, I tried to google "village doll"
You'll quickly notice a lot of reference to the village of Nagoro in Japan, known as the village of dolls. You'll see on a lot of picture the lamp which is also present on the picture.

So this is the answer to the first challenge : md5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoro)

Lets now focus on the second picture which is very easy.

This time we can see a kind of castle on the right. I decided to crop the picture to focus only on the castle and then try a reverse image

The result is quite straightforward. So this time, the answer is md5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_Caldora) 

For the last part, I used almost the same approach

I decided to crop the right part and do a reverse image only with the left part. This time, we see a lot of reference to the village of Shirakawa-g≈ç. So I tried md5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirakawa,_Gifu_(village)) and it worked ! 

The flag is : flag{e827a89870a9089870ca28d28e50ceb7}

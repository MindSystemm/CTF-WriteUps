Description : Can you find them all?

**Solution** : 

This challenge was very interesting because it requires to use more your brain than online tool. So let's focus on the first picture. 
We can see a doll, a lamp and finally a house in the background. You can try all the reverse image tools that exists, they won't give any results. 
The big hint here is the doll. At first, I thought it was a scarescrow but it didn't give any results. So after a while, I tried to google "village doll"
You'll quickly notice a lot of reference to the village of Nagoro in Japan, known as the village of dolls. You'll see on a lot of picture the lamp which is also present on the picture.

So this is the answer to the first challenge : md5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoro)

Description : *The Client is in full control. Bypass the authentication and read the key to get the Flag.*\

**Solution** : 

This file is a .net file so you can view the source code with any .net decompiler (I recommend you use dnSpy) \
After a quick look at the code, I decided to debug the exe and modify it to make him give me the flag. \
I set a BP on this method because I noticed it use writeline and then I debugged the exe and input a random user/pass combination \
